 Vim is the best editor in the world, and gdb the best debugger. Try to imagine the integration of both. Well, let me just say that if God had this tool when he wrote the world, this would have been a better place.

 Idevim also features an Assembley debugger, and other features like Automatic Core Dump detection etc. All in all, it is the best IDE for a Vim fan.
